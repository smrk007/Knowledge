Psychology of Learning

    Mechanics of Memory:
        1.  We make new memories by relating new knowledge to previously held knowledge.
            - Hence to attain new memories, we must "interpret, connect, interrelate, and elaborate" the new memories based on our existing memories.
            - In practice, this is the importance of paraphrasing one's notes in order to attain deeper knowledge.
            - PHILOSOPHICAL THOUGHT: Does this then further support the idea of coherence over correspondance as a way of knowing?
        2.  Memory capacity is essentially unlimited, and learning new things "expands capacity"
            - More memories means more points of relation (point 1)
        3.  Information retrieval is dependent upon the environment and the relations built
        4.  Information retrieval is a self strengthening event, making future recall more ready
            - Hence, actual practice is a stronger predictor of retention
    Learning Techniques:
        1.  Short, focused, and spaced out study sessions are better than long ones
        2.  Studying a mixture of topics is better than studying one in exclusion
        3.  Studying in a variety of different ways and environments is better than having one study space and technique 
        4.  Testing yourself and recall is better than looking up information while studying
            - Notecards, practice problems
    Assessment of Learning:
        1.  Two major biases in determining the degree to which knowledge has been learned:
            - Foresight Bias: Belief that information will be easily accessed in the future, because it is currently fresh
                - Could be mitigated in part by spacing out study sessions and mixing topics (Techniques 1 and 2)
            - Hindsight Bias: Belief that, because information is available, we believe it will be easily recalled in the future
                - Example: Student who skims over a textbook and thinks about what topics seem familiar before a test
                - Could be mitigated in part by testing for recall (Technique 4)
        2.  These biases can be mitigated by adhering to the techniques established in "Learning Techniques"
