# C & C++ Macros Knowledge

    Interesting tidbits...

        * The following characters...
            .   )   (   ]   [   "   ,
        All behave as whitespace when replacing macros. For example, with the following definition:
            #define TEST() test
        We experience these replacements:
            "TEST()test" becomes "test test"
            "TEST().test" becomes "test.test"
            "testTEST()" becomes "testTEST()"
            "test.TEST()" becomes "test.test"
            "test()TEST()" becomes "test()test"
        
        * When placing a # before an argument in a macro:
            #define Q(x) #x
        The argument will become itself in quotations. Eg:
            "Q(hello)" becomes ""hello""
